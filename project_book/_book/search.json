To enhance the match between calculation an experiment, it is helpful to consider the relative transmission amplitude rather than the absolute:\n\\[\n    \\hat{t}_r(T) \\equiv \\frac{\\Delta\\hat{t}}{\\hat{t}_0} = \\frac{\\hat{S}(T) - \\hat{S}_0}{\\hat{S}_0}\n\\tag{1.2}\\]\nThis removes any hidden response functions from the experiment that were not successfully deconvolved from the signal. We choose \\(\\hat{S}_0 = \\hat{S}(T_{\\mathrm{min}})\\) with \\(T_{\\mathrm{min}}\\) being the base temperature of the optical cryostat of about 10 kelvin.\nSimilarly, for the calculation, the relative transmission amplitude is\n\\[\n    \\hat{t}_r(\\sigma, \\sigma_0) \\equiv \\frac{\\Delta\\hat{t}}{\\hat{t}_0} = \\frac{\\hat{S}(\\sigma) - \\hat{S}(\\sigma_0)}{\\hat{S}(\\sigma_0)}\n\\tag{1.3}\\]\nwhere \\(\\sigma_0\\) is the conductivity of the sample at the base temperature \\(T_{\\mathrm{min}}\\), which is not known a priori. By moving to this relative representation, we add one extra unknown to our problem, namely the value of \\(\\sigma_0 = \\sigma(|t|)\\), which is a shared parameter for all temperatures \\(T\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: To the left, the experimental relative spectra; to the right, the calculated relative spectra, for a fixed choice of \\(\\sigma_0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe seek to find \\(\\sigma_0\\) and \\(\\{\\sigma\\}_T\\) that solves\n\\[\n    \\min_{\\sigma_0} \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N  \\min_\\sigma \\,\\lVert \\hat{t}_{r, \\mathrm{meas}}(T_i) - \\hat{t}_{r, \\mathrm{calc}}(\\sigma,\\sigma_0)\n\\tag{1.4}\\]\nwhere \\(\\lVert\\cdot\\rVert\\) is the norm over the frequency domain. The calculations of the relative transmission amplitude are performed on a dense grid of \\(\\sigma\\), and cubic interpolation is used to estimate the relative transmission amplitude at arbitrary conductivities.\nTo find the optimal reference conductivity (\\(\\sigma_0\\)), we perform the inner minimization for each candidate \\(\\sigma_0\\) to obtain the optimal set \\(\\{\\sigma\\}_T\\), in the sense of minimizing the residual sum of squares. This gives us an outer error measure \\(\\varepsilon_{\\sigma_0}\\) for each candidate \\(\\sigma_0\\),\n\\[\n    \\varepsilon(\\sigma_0) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N  \\min_\\sigma \\,\\lVert \\hat{t}_{r, \\mathrm{meas}}(T_i) - \\hat{t}_{r, \\mathrm{calc}}(\\sigma,\\sigma_0)\\rVert\n\\tag{1.5}\\]\nwhich we plot in Figure 1.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: The aggregate error as defined in Equation 1.5, as a function of the reference conductivity \\(\\sigma_0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nFortunately this has a global minimum, and we have a good estimate for the reference conductivity \\(\\sigma_0\\). Fixing this \\(\\sigma_0\\), we can go back and explore the error landscape in the space of \\(\\sigma\\),\n\\[\n    \\varepsilon(\\sigma, T) = \\,\\lVert \\hat{t}_{r, \\mathrm{meas}}(T) - \\hat{t}_{r, \\mathrm{calc}}(\\sigma)\\rVert_2\n\\tag{1.6}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: The aggregate error as defined in Equation 1.5, as a function of the reference conductivity \\(\\sigma\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe error is larger at higher temperatures, since that is where the relative transmission amplitude is also the largest. But there is at least one minimum for each temperature, and we get good estimates for the conductivity at each temperature. There is a local minimum around \\(\\sigma = 3\\times10^3\\) which is temperature independent, and therefore not physical. We therefore restrict the minima to \\(\\sigma &gt; 3\\times10^3\\), and obtain unique solutions.\nWe inspect the \\(\\hat{t}_r\\) experimental and calculated distributions, and the corresponding residuals, in Figure 1.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: Solution to Equation 1.4. To the left, the experimental relative spectra; in the middle the calculated relative spectra, and to the right the residuals.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe residuals are small, and the match between calculation and experiment is acceptable, aside from a systematic error related to an overall slope. The final mapping from temperature to conductivity is shown in Figure 4.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: The mapping that solves Equation 1.4.",

    "text": "6.2 Calculations\nThe transmission amplitude of the sample can be calculated theoretically, with the simplifying assumption that any field-induced variation in conductivity occurs exclusively in the capacitor-like gap of the split-ring resonator.\nAiming to map the theoretical resonator-gap conductivity \\(\\sigma\\) to the experimental parameters \\(T\\) and \\(\\mathscr{E}_r\\), we need to choose the appropriate reference spectrum when calculating the relative transmission amplitude,\n\\[\n\\hat{t}_r(\\sigma_0 = \\sigma_0(T)) = \\frac{\\Delta\\hat{t}}{\\hat{t}_0} = \\frac{\\hat{t}(\\sigma, \\sigma_0) - \\hat{t}(\\sigma = \\sigma_0)}{\\hat{t}(\\sigma = \\sigma_0)}\n\\]\nTo do this, we need to make a choice for \\(\\sigma_0\\), which is different for each temperature, and possibly for each field-strength. If we assume it is independent of field strength (viz. the field only affects the material in the resonator gap), we can use the analysis of the linear spectroscopy data, where a correspondence between temperature and film conductivity was obtained, as shown in Figure 6.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Summary of raw differential waveforms, recorded after transmission through the sample for various values of the THz pump field strength and sample temperature. In black, the equilibrium absolute waveform.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen we obtain \\(\\sigma(T,\\mathscr{E}_r)\\) by solving Equation 6.2, which we call the fixed-\\(\\sigma_0\\) minimization.\n\\[\n    \\min_{\\sigma} \\epsilon(T,\\mathscr{E}_r ; \\sigma, \\sigma_0)\\Big\\vert_{\\sigma_0 = \\sigma_0(T)}\n\\tag{6.2}\\]\nwhere\n\\[\n    \\epsilon(T,\\mathscr{E}_r;\\sigma,\\sigma_0) = \\sum_{i}\\left\\lvert w(f_i)\\left(\\hat{t}_{r, \\mathrm{meas}}(f_i; T, \\mathscr{E}_r) - \\hat{t}_{r, \\mathrm{calc}}(f_i; {\\sigma},\\sigma_0)\\right)\\right\\rvert^2\n\\tag{6.3}\\]\nthe weighted residual sum of squares, with \\(w(f)\\) a weighting function that peaks around the resonance frequency.\nOn the other hand, we can also solve for both the local resonator gap conductivity \\(\\sigma\\) and the film conductivity \\(\\sigma_0\\) in a bilevel minimization scheme, determining both \\(\\sigma\\) and \\(\\sigma_0\\) from the same experiment. This leaves two choices: either we assume, as we did in the fixed-\\(\\sigma_0\\) minimization, that \\(\\sigma_0 = \\sigma_0(T)\\), and does not depend on field strength \\(\\mathscr{E}_r\\), or we allow \\(\\sigma_0\\) to vary with \\(\\mathscr{E}_r\\) as well. We call these the rigid-\\(\\sigma_0\\) minimization and the free-\\(\\sigma_0\\) minimization, respectively.\nThe rigid-\\(\\sigma_0\\) minimization is given by Equation 6.4, \\[\n    \\min_{\\sigma_0} \\Big\\langle \\epsilon(T,\\mathscr{E}_r ; \\sigma,\\sigma_0)\\Big\\vert_{\\sigma = \\sigma^\\ast} \\Big\\rangle_{\\mathscr{E}_r}\n    \\quad\\mathrm{where}\\quad\n    \\sigma^\\ast(T,\\mathscr{E}_r;\\sigma_0) = \\arg\\min_{\\sigma} \\epsilon(T,\\mathscr{E}_r ; \\sigma, \\sigma_0)\n\\tag{6.4}\\]\nwhere \\(\\langle\\cdot\\rangle_\\alpha\\) denotes the mean over variable \\(\\alpha\\). The free-\\(\\sigma_0\\) minimization is given by Equation 6.5,\n\\[\n    \\min_{\\sigma_0} \\epsilon(T,\\mathscr{E}_r ; \\sigma,\\sigma_0)\\Big\\vert_{\\sigma = \\sigma^\\ast}\n    \\quad\\mathrm{where}\\quad\n    \\sigma^\\ast(T,\\mathscr{E}_r;\\sigma_0) = \\arg\\min_{\\sigma} \\epsilon(T,\\mathscr{E}_r ; \\sigma, \\sigma_0)\n\\tag{6.5}\\]\nwhere the inner error is not averaged over \\(\\mathscr{E}_r\\). In Figure 6.3, we compare the results of these three minimzation schemes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: The resonator-gap conductivity as a function of field strength \\(\\mathscr{E}_r\\) and temperature \\(T\\), shown for each of the three minimization schemes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe solutions are quite consistent with each other, giving the same trends while displaying some differences in absolute values. Henceforth, we will use the fixed-\\(\\sigma_0\\) minimization, as this ensures consistency with the linear spectroscopy data and with other analyses, and takes advantage of the high-quality solution of the linear spectroscopy experiment. We can look at this data as a function of temperature, for fixed field strengths, or as a function of field-strength, for fixed temperatures.

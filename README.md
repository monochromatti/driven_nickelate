# Terahertz-field driven nickelates

This repository contains the data and analysis scripts for an experimental work involving conductivity dynamics of NdNiO<sub>3</sub> thin films under terahertz field excitation. A free-space pulsed terahertz field is generated by optical rectification of a femtosecond laser pulse (1.5 eV photon energy, 100 fs pulse duration), and is locally amplified in the thin film through the deposition of gold terahertz resonators (electric split-ring resonators).

## Installation
The project is packaged with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), so make sure to have that installed. 

Start by downloading the data from [doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12752053](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12752053/), using 

```shell
uv run data-download
```

To work with the project, a virtual environment is typically used. This is created with `uv venv`. After you activate it (typically with `source .venv/bin/activate`), run `uv sync` to install dependencies.
